# rpi-mosquitto

Raspberry Pi compatible Docker Image with mosquitto MQTT broker.
Based upon [docker-mosquitto](https://github.com/toke/docker-mosquitto).

## How to run

```
docker run -tip 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 pascaldevink/rpi-mosquitto
```

Exposes Port 1883 (MQTT) 9001 (Websocket MQTT)

Alternatively you can use volumes to make the changes persistent and change the configuration.
```
mkdir -p /srv/mqtt/config/
mkdir -p /srv/mqtt/data/
mkdir -p /srv/mqtt/log/
# place your mosquitto.conf in /srv/mqtt/config/
# NOTE: You have to change the permissions of the directories
# to allow the user to read/write to data and log and read from
# config directory
# For TESTING purposes you can use chmod -R 777 /srv/mqtt/*
# Better use "-u" with a valid user id on your docker host

docker run -ti -p 1883:1883 -p 9001:9001 \
-v /srv/mqtt/config:/mqtt/config:ro \
-v /srv/mqtt/log:/mqtt/log \
